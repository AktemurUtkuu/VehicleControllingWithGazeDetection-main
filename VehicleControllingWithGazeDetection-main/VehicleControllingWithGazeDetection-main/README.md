# VehicleControllingWithGazeDetection
"This project aims to develop a vehicle that can be controlled using eye movements. Eye direction is detected via a computer webcam, then sent over Wi-Fi to an ESP32 module. The ESP32 transmits the data to an Arduino, which controls the vehicle's motors. The goal is to create an innovative and alternative control mechanism."
